When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    A remote repository would be helpful when more than one person are working on a project and when you are working on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is better to pull changes manually so you can control when updates occur incase you don't want to merge with updates from GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are local copies of code from a repository which could be a fork created in your own repository or from the main project repository. Forking would be used when you do not have access to push to the main project repository. Branches are segments of code connected to the master branch by nodes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to compare to your master branch and make any changes and merge prior to pushing or pulling to GitHub

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    To collaborate without using Gti or GitHub, you could make copies of a directory or file and save to your workspace. Changes you make could then be copied to a shared drive with a versioned name. An e-mail or text file could be sent or updated to reflect changes. For just one person or maybe two to three, depending on the work flow, this could work without being to messy if everyone agreed and followed a set procedure. For multiple collaborators and for those not accessing a shared drive, Git and GitHub appears like a much better workflow.
     

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
